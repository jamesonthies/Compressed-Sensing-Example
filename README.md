# Compressed-Sensing-Example
Compressed Sensing Demo for EEC 266 Presentation. <br/>
full_example.py runs a single CS simulation and displays original data, sparse data, recovered sparse data, and recovered signal. 1<br/>
make_fig1.py displays the simulation data and its sparse representations. <br/>
make_fig2.py runs 4 CS simulations at different compression ratios and displays the reconstructed data or all.
